# material-web-color
Update to the algorithms and utilities that power the Material Design 3 (M3) color system, including choosing theme colors from images and creating tones of colors.

I had several issues with the Theme Utilities not generating all of the appropriate colors or applying them.  Keep in mind, this is using ```Scheme``` and not ```DynamicScheme``` for the fix.  ```Scheme``` is going away but in my experience the other doesn't generate the same colors.

I'm putting this here for my own reference and cause it might help others.  I won't be maintaining this one but might be updating when I find better ways while working on my current client.  Hopefully, this won't be needed soon.

Make sure to install https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material/material-color-utilities first!
